        This is a React/Redux app I created during Week 11 of the DevelopeMe_ coding bootcamp. I built up the app throughout the week's exercises learning Redux, React Redux (subscribing and dispatching), as well as API actions to utilize a pre-existing backend API.

        The app is meant to be used to keep score for ping pong games. You can configure player names, the winning # of points, and serve frequency. Then you're able to keep score while playing the game. Finally you can see the history of past matches that were played. I also did a basic translation to Esperanto.
